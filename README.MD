#Reflection and Self-Evaluation

For the third and final assessment task, I aimed to implement the concepts and features expected of a modern webpage which implements future web technologies. The brief suggested using AI-generated content to develop this website, however, the moral and legal issues surrounding the use of AI-generated content present a shaky and uncertain future for their usage on the web (Marr, 2024). I also have personal reservations in my feelings around AI-generated content, and as such did not feel comfortable including it in my solution.

As I do not come from a programming background, attempting to construct the site in a more complex framework such as the React or Angular JavaScript frameworks would have been a significant challenge as I have little experience in JavaScript development. Choosing to play to my strengths and the current front end development trends, I chose to develop my ‘web future’ design around a Tailwind CSS website.

In my approach to developing this website, I made the decision to focus on a modern and device-friendly front-end user experience while formatting the website in a structure which would be easy to modify and improve over time. For the content of my website, I chose to develop a portfolio site as I am graduating this semester and building a portfolio is an important part of showcasing yourself as a designer. As the future of the web transcends one singular screen size and layout, I developed a responsive grid layout which is designed to scale to the window size seamlessly, allowing small devices and large monitors to view the site with relative accuracy.

During my development process, I attempted to utilise a Javascript animation library to place animations on my site. I tried both anime.js and GSAP, but found difficulty in implementing them due to my lack of experience in JavaScript and integrating with Tailwind. I then discovered a lightweight JS animation library by Github user ‘michalsnik’ which served as a sub-par but suitable solution for my animations. Externally implementing an independent library with limited features such as this is not an optimal solution for website development, however, I was beginning to feel out of my depth at this stage of the project and struggled to find a way to implement these animations otherwise.

When it came to finalising my project I had a late complication in my work which made it impossible to finish within the original deadline. It was a challenge to reorient myself after a major setback such as this, so I slowed down my process and carefully implemented each change to ensure a catastrophic error could not occur again. When developing projects in the future, I will endeavour to create comprehensive documentation and I will ensure I track the changes between each version in order to avoid a major setback such as this.

While I feel the front-end user experience of my final portfolio site is performant and clean, I believe that I am capable of a much more interactive and well produced front end website design, and will be working hard to ensure future web projects meet my personal standards.
